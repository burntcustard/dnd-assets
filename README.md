# dnd-assets

A collection of tokens, maps, and other art I've created or heavily modified for my TTRPG (mostly D&amp;D) games.

## AI art

Several tokens and bits of art were created with [Midjourney](https://www.midjourney.com).

I am aware of the questionable ethics of both training AI art models, and the potential of AI art to reduce the wellbeing of real artists. I fully support companies and policies which ban AI art in finished products (e.g. the [D&D Statement on AI](https://www.dndbeyond.com/posts/1642-updated-statement-on-ai)). I am not intending to benefit financially from any images in this repository that were created at any stage with generative AI tools.

Some AI generated art may appear alongside .txt files including prompts and/or credits of artwork fed (often in a heavily modified state) into Midjourney.

## Image types and compression

Most tokens are PNGs for compatibility reasons. Most maps are WebP, because of it's much smaller filesize and because it works well within my favourite VTT [Owlbear Rodeo](https://www.owlbear.rodeo/).

Small files like monster tokens have been run through [TinyPNG](https://tinypng.com/).

Larger files like maps have been run through [Squoosh](https://squoosh.app/) to convert them to WebP. Settings used vary wildly, but I attempt to keep each map under 1MB.

XCF or PNG source files for complex tokens or maps with many additions/modifications are available on request - some are 200MB+ so are not included in this repository.

## Licence & sources

Several maps are based on maps by [Czepeku]((https://www.czepeku.com/)). They are the #1 RPG map makers on Patreon, and create beautiful maps that I use whenever I can in my D&D games. So please go [check out Czepeku's website](https://www.czepeku.com/) and consider subscribing to [their Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/czepeku)!

Several tokens and small assets included in maps are by various artists on [2-Minute Tabletop](https://2minutetabletop.com/). The 'pay what you want' model there is fantastically generous, and Ross, the artist behind that website creates incredibly useful TTRPG art of all shapes and sizes.

This whole repository is MIT licenced, and any artwork (image files) which include or are based on existing art are hosted under the intention of [Fair Use](https://copyrightalliance.org/faqs/what-is-fair-use/).

Art that is based on or includes other original works are listed beside a .txt file of the same name, or a .txt file of the same name as the containing folder, which includes credits and a link where possible to the originals.

If you believe you are the owner of artwork here and do not see my modifications and public distribution as 'Fair Use', then please email me at [john@burnt.io](mailto:john@burnt.io) and I will remove offending files within 24 hours.

## Other tools

[The Fateful Force's VTT Token Maker](https://thefatefulforce.com/battle-resources/token-creator/) was used for creating several tokens. It's not very good, and I often re-save the tokens it outputs with a white background and then feed them through [remove.bg](https://www.remove.bg/) to get rid of the dodgy aliasing and background overflow.

[GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/) was used in the creation of almost all the art here.

[2 Minute Tabletop's Sticker Editor](https://tools.2minutetabletop.com/sticker) was used to put white outlines around some tokens. It's not very good as it introduces aliasing and/or glowy edges. You can somewhat negate those downsides by giving it high resolution images, and then downscaling afterwards.
